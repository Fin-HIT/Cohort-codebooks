# Cohort codebooks
The Finnish Health in Teens study – Fin-HIT – is a prospective school-based cohort study including approximately 11,000 Finnish adolescents aged 9–12 years at enrolment across densely populated areas of Finland.

This repository contains a complete list of data items and their descriptions, collected at three time points:
- [Baseline Data / First Wave (2011–2014) of children](./First_Wave_Codebook_Children.csv)
- [Baseline Data / First Wave (2011–2014) of parents](./First_Wave_Codebook_Guardians.csv)
- [Second Wave (2015–2016) of children](./Second_Wave_Codebook_Children.csv)
- [Second Wave (2015–2016) of parents](./Second_Wave_Codebook_Guardian.csv)
- [Third Wave (2020–2024)](./Third_Wave_Codebook.csv)

You can use these codebooks to better understand our cohort and to support analysis planning for any collaborative research projects.
