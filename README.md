# Cohort codebooks
The Finnish Health in Teens study – Fin-HIT – is a prospective school-based cohort study including approximately 11,000 Finnish adolescents aged 9–12 years at enrolment across densely populated areas of Finland.

This repository contains a complete list of data items and their descriptions, collected at three time points:
- [Baseline Data (2011–2014)](./Baseline_Codebook_Children.xlsx)
- [Follow-up 1 (2015–2016)](./Followup_1_Codebook_Children.xlsx)
- [Follow-up 2 (2020–2024)](./Followup_2_Codebook_English.xlsx)

You can use these codebooks to better understand our cohort and to support analysis planning for any collaborative research projects.

If you are interested in collaborating using these data, please contact the project lead Heli Viljakainen (heli.viljakainen@folkhalsan.fi).
